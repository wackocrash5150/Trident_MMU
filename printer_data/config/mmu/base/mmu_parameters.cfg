# EDIT THIS FILE BASED ON YOUR SETUP

# Note that macro configuration is specifed separately in 'mmu_macro_vars.cfg'.

happy_hare_version: 2.60	# Don't mess, used for upgrade detection
#
# The vendor and version config is important to define the capabilities of the MMU and basic CAD dimensions. These can
# all be overridden with the `cad` parameters detailed in the documentation but the vendor setting saves time.
#
# ERCF
# 1.1 original design, add "s" suffix for Sprigy, "b" for Binky, "t" for Triple-Decky
#     e.g. "1.1sb" for v1.1 with Springy mod and Binky encoder
#
# 2.0 new community ERCFv2
#
# Tradrack
# 1.0 add "e" if using encoder is fitted
#
# Prusa
#  - Comming soon (use Other for now)
#
# Other
#  - Generic setup that will require further customization of 'cad' parameters. See doc and section at the end
#
mmu_vendor: Tradrack			# MMU family
mmu_version: 1.0e			# MMU hardware version number (add mod suffix documented above)
mmu_num_gates: 8 			# Number of selector gates


# MMU Hardware Limits --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Define the physical limits of your MMU. These setings will be respected regardless of individual speed settings.
#
gear_max_velocity: 300			# Never to be exceeded gear velocity regardless of specific parameters
gear_max_accel: 1500			# Never to be exceeded gear accelaration regardless of specific parameters
selector_max_velocity: 250		# Never to be exceeded selector velocity regardless of specific parameters
selector_max_accel: 1200		# Never to be exceeded selector accelaration regardless of specific parameters


# Servo configuration  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Angle of the servo in three named positions
#   up   = tool is selected and filament is allowed to freely move through gate
#   down = to grip filament
#   move = ready the servo for selector move (optional - defaults to up)
# V2.4 on: These positions are only for initial config they are replaced with calibrated servo positions in `mmu_vars.cfg`
#
# Note that leaving the servo active when down can stress the electronics and is not recommended with EASY-BRD or ERB board
# unless the 5v power supply has been improved and it is not necessary with standard ERCF builds
# Make sure your hardware is suitable for the job!
#
servo_up_angle: 145			# ERCF: MG90S: 30  ; SAVOX SH0255MG: 140 ; Tradrack: 145
servo_down_angle: 1			# ERCF: MG90S: 140 ; SAVOX SH0255MG: 30  ; Tradrack: 1
servo_move_angle: 145			# Optional angle used when selector is moved (defaults to up position)
servo_duration: 0.2			# Duration of PWM burst sent to servo (default non-active mode, automatically turns off)
servo_dwell: 0.5			# Minimum time given to servo to complete movement prior to next move
servo_always_active: 0 			# CAUTION: 1=Force servo to always stay active, 0=Release after movement
servo_active_down: 0			# CAUTION: 1=Force servo to stay active when down only, 0=Release after movement
servo_buzz_gear_on_down: 0		# Whether to "buzz" the gear stepper on down to aid engagement


# Logging --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# log_level & logfile_level can be set to one of (0 = essential, 1 = info, 2 = debug, 3 = trace, 4 = stepper moves)
# Generally you can keep console logging to a minimal whilst still sending debug output to the mmu.log file
# Increasing the console log level is only really useful during initial setup to save having to constantly open the log file
#
log_level: 1
log_file_level: 2			# Can also be set to -1 to disable log file completely
log_statistics: 1 			# 1 to log statistics on every toolchange (default), 0 to disable (but still recorded)
log_visual: 1				# 1 log visual representation of filament, 0 = disable
log_startup_status: 1			# Whether to log tool to gate status on startup, 1 = summary (default), 2 = full, 0 = disable


# Movement speeds ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Long moves are faster than the small ones and used for the bulk of the bowden movement. Note that you can set two fast
# load speeds depending on whether MMU thinks it is pulling from the buffer or from the spool. It is often helpful to
# use a lower speed when pulling from the spool because more force is required to overcome friction and this prevents
# loosing steps. 100mm/s should be "quiet" with the NEMA14 motor but you can go lower for really low noise
#
# NOTE: Encoder cannot keep up much above 350mm/s so make sure 'bowden_apply_correction' is off at very high speeds!
#
gear_from_buffer_speed: 150		# mm/s Normal speed when loading filament. Conservative is 100mm/s, Max around 300mm/s
gear_from_buffer_accel: 400		# Normal accelaration when loading filament
gear_from_spool_speed: 80		# mm/s Use (lower) speed when loading for the first time (i.e. pulling from spool)
gear_from_spool_accel: 100		# Accelaration when loading from spool
#
gear_short_move_speed: 80		# mm/s Speed when making short moves (like incremental retracts with encoder)
gear_short_move_accel: 600		# Usually the same as gear_from_buffer_accel (for short movements)
gear_short_move_threshold: 70		# Move distance that controls application of 'short_move' speed/accel
gear_homing_speed: 50			# mm/s Speed of gear stepper only homing moves (e.g. homing to gate or extruder)

# Speeds of extruder movement. The 'sync' speeds will be used when gear and extruder steppers are moving in sync
#
extruder_load_speed: 16			# mm/s speed of load move inside extruder from homing position to meltzone
extruder_unload_speed: 16		# mm/s speed of unload moves inside of extruder (very initial move from meltzone is 50% of this)
extruder_sync_load_speed: 18		# mm/s speed of synchronized extruder load moves
extruder_sync_unload_speed: 18		# mm/s speed of synchronized extruder unload moves
extruder_homing_speed: 20		# mm/s speed of extruder only homing moves (e.g. to toolhead sensor)

# Selector movement speeds. (Accelaration is defined by physical MMU limits set above and passed to selector stepper driver)
#
selector_move_speed: 200		# mm/s speed of selector movement (not touch)
selector_homing_speed: 60		# mm/s speed of initial selector homing move (not touch)
selector_touch_speed: 80		# mm/s speed of all touch selector moves (if stallguard configured)

# Selector touch (stallguard) operation. If stallguard is configured, then this can be used to switch on touch movement which
# can detect blocked filament path and try to recover automatically but it is more difficult to set up
#
selector_touch_enable: 0		# If selector touch operation configured this can be used to disable it 1=enabled, 0=disabled


# Gate loading/unloading -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These setttings control the loading and unloading filament at the gate. The primary options are you use a endstop switch
# at the gate (ala TradRack) or an encoder (ERCF default).  You can even have both a gate sensor for loading/parking and
# still use the encoder for other move verification (see advanced 'gate_endstop_to_encoder' option).
# Note: the `encoder` method, due to the nature of its operation will overshoot a little. This is not a problem in practice
# because the overshoot will simply be compensated for in the subsequent fast bowden move.
# 
# Possible gate_homing_endtop names:
#   encoder  - Detect filament position using movement of the encoder
#   mmu_gate - Detect filament using a gate endstop if configured
#
gate_homing_endstop: mmu_gate		# Name of gate endstop, "encoder" forces use of encoder for parking
gate_homing_max: 70			# Maximum move distance to home to the gate (actual move distance for encoder parking)
